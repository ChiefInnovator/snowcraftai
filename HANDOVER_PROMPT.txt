You are an expert Game Developer specializing in Phaser 3.

I am working on "Snowcraft Reforged," a web-based remake of the 1998 classic.
I have the core game engine written in Phaser 3 (`index.html`), but I need help sourcing the assets and finalizing the setup.

CONTEXT:
- The game logic is complete (2.5D physics, AI, Level Manager).
- It relies on external assets that must be sourced from an existing open-source remake.

YOUR TASK:
1. Analyze the GitHub repository `https://github.com/jeffreywilbur/snowcraftjs`.
   - Specifically look in the `wwwroot/images` and `wwwroot/sounds` folders.
2. Identify the correct files for:
   - Red Team Sprites (Idle/Throw).
   - Green Team Sprites (Idle/Throw).
   - Snowball Image.
   - Sound Effects (Throw, Hit, Step/Crunch).
3. Guide me on how to download or extract these specific files.
4. Compare the dimensions of the downloaded sprites against my code in `index.html` (which currently expects 32x48 frames).
5. If the dimensions differ, modify the `preload()` function in `index.html` to match the actual assets from the repository.
